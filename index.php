									 <h3>The Company</h3>
								 	<p><strong style="color:#996633">Consolidated Electric Power Asia Limited (CEPA)</strong> was established for the purpose of assisting developing countries with high electricity demand. Hopewell Holdingâ€™s power project investments were grouped under Consolidated Electric Power Asia Limited and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in late 1993, to develop and operate power generation projects throughout Asia. Originally a subsidiary of Hopewell Holding, Slipform Engineering Ltd. and Tileman Group were then put under CEPA. Senior management and executives of the companies were also transferred to the new companies under CEPA.</p>
								 	<p><strong style="color:#996633">CEPA</strong> built up to become the largest private power company in Asia at that time, with projects in China, the Philippines, Indonesia and India. CEPA constructs, develops, finances and operates power plants. CEPA provides on-site operation and maintenance services to ensure smooth and efficient operations of power stations and power barges.</p>
								 	<p><strong style="color:#996633">Mr. Stewart Elliott</strong> is the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Group. The principal activities of CEPA and its subsidiary companies are development & operation of power station projects, civil construction and engineering services, project management & treasury investments.</p>
